	@description = The future is here and it is even more amazing than we expected.  We've gone from printing black dots on white paper to printing metal dots on black cardboard!  This amazing 3D printer from HextecH can serve all your on-orbit material needs.  Using available supplies of powdered materials, the 3D printer can "print" up almost anything you need from spart parts to new thruster nozzles.  Warning: Any attempt to print Kerbals will result in forseen consequences (it won't work).
